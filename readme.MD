# Preparing titanic dataset for further analysis using pandas, numpy and jupiter notebook

Playing with titanic dataset as a training to prepare it for further data analysis:

- checking data in each column,
- changing dtypes,
- playing with null values; replacing by mean, mode(most frequent),
- playing with strings,
- using map function, crosstab, value_counts, unique, groupby and much more

Additionally working on custom stats to faster analyze the data, see what column could be the key, which should categorized as 'category' dtype, whether there might be booleans and checking the % completness of the data. 

Reduced the file memory usage by 60%.
